# GymIOS


This IOS application was fully programmed in Swift.

This is a fitness app; create your profile by placing all your physical information, and using AI, you'll get your own personalized routine, keeping in mind your goal.

# Getting Started

Users start by creating their profile and entering their name, email, and password. The application will create your own personalized routine, keeping in mind your time availability, your goal, where you will be working out, and your advised diet.

All of this information will be anonymously handled to create a personalized routine for every day, a calorie consumption goal as well as protein and sugars.

Once created, just log in with your email and password!

Don't worry about security; the app uses JWT tokens to communicate with the server to make sure your profile is always secure.

# Accessing your workout!

After logging in, your device will keep your JWT token stored, and it will be valid for the next week.

Then just check your routine on the main page
